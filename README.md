# API_Project_2 :night_with_stars:


## Project Description

This project asks you to develop a single-page site that is progressively enhanced with JavaScript and that responds to user input to pull in data from an open JSON API that does not require authorization.
Project Goals

* Understand and execute progressively enhanced, unobtrusive and asynchronous JavaScript
* Work with an open API, learning how to hit its endpoints in response to user input
* Process JSON-formatted data and present it in valid well-formed semantic HTML, styled with CSS

## Deliverables & Milestones

* A single HTML page that loads your program as a separate .js file
* A GitHub repository containing the draft of your project. Link posted to Basecamp by Thursday, October 5
* Substantive comments on all other student projects by Sunday, October 9
* An email to the instructor containing the projects final deliverables by Thursday, October 12, 11:59pm CT:
* A 4-5 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point (write in the body of the email)         The https:// link to your projectâ€™s GitHub repository

## Requirements
* Your JSON data API must:
    1. Be openly available (no authentication required)
    2. Allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) through headers or another mechanism
* Your JavaScript program must:
    1. Run error-free in the browser, but also provide some form of error handling
    2. Operate on a standards-compliant DOM
    3. Be attached to an HTML/CSS design that has the foundations of responsive design
    4. Be written in native JavaScript (no CoffeeScript or other pre-processors)
    5. Use asynchronous pattersn to retrieve API data
    6. Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf HTML or CSS frameworks)
* A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make
     GitHub repository must contain only the files and commits from this project; you are encouraged to use and further improve your HTML files from Project 1
